# 🔥 Helium - A Compiler Built from Scratch in C++

## 📖 Overview

Helium is a from-scratch implementation of a compiler designed to translate a custom programming language into executable machine code. This project aims to explore compiler design, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Lexical Analysis - Tokenization of source code
* ✅ Parsing - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
* ✅ Semantic Analysis - Type checking and validation
* ✅ Optimization - Code transformations for performance
* ✅ Code Generation - Emitting assembly or IR
* ✅ Error Handling - Clear and detailed error reporting

```
git clone https://github.com/username/Helium.git
cd Helium
```

## 📝 Usage
